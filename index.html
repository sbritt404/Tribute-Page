            <ul>
                <li>Cats have associated with humans for up to 10,000 years.</li>
                <li>The oldest known burial of a domesticated cat comes from Cyprus, where a human and a cat were buried
                    together 9,500 years ago.</li>
                <li>Felines display object permanence, which is the ability to realize that something still exists when
                    it's
                    out of sight.</li>
                <li>Unlike dogs, which are pack animals, cats evolved from a solitary wild lifestyle.</li>
                <li>Cats have excellent vision, their eyes are loaded with sensing cells called cones, which provide
                    acuity in bright light. </li>
                <li>Cats aren't particularly strong smellers, but their sense of hearing is very sensitive.</li>
            </ul>
